    <p class="instructions">
      This tool is for legacy Cognate customers who wish to retrieve their Trademark Documentation records from the
      Ethereum blockchain. To retrieve your records, use the input field below to enter a Word Mark or the Design Mark
      location (provided in the email you received from Cognate regarding this tool) and select your mark from the
      options that are shown. The result data that appears below includes your mark and the documentation associated
      with it that is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. We also provide links to the Etherscan record for each Ethereum
      Smart Contract associated with the data. It is in these contracts that your data is stored in byte code, our tool
      is extracting the data and displaying it in a more appropriate format for you. For design marks (those consisting
      of an image), we include the design hash along with the mark image. This hash is a SHA-256 hash representation of
      the image data (the EXACT IMAGE that was provided to Cognate at the time of your data submission, the image shown
      here in this tool IS THAT IMAGE, however another version of your design mark image will not work) and is what is
      stored on the Ethereum blockchain (the image is not). You can however, use this hash to prove the existence of
      your mark image at the point the time that the blockchain record exists. To do this, you can use any
      <a href="https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator" target="_blank">third party SHA-256 converter</a>
      or the SHA-256 tool provided below. The SHA-256 hash of your design image will match the hash that is stored on
      the blockchain. This is known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence">Proof of Existence</a>. We have employed the same
      methodology for your Proof of Use documents, however for data protection reasons, those documents have been
      provided to you to keep hold of outside of this tool. Finally here is a link to the
      <a href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access">github repository for this tool's source code</a>.
