      <p>
        This tool is for legacy Cognate customers who wish to retrieve their trademark documentation records from the
        Ethereum blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        To retrieve your records, use the input field below to enter a Word Mark or the Design Mark location (provided
        in the email you received from Cognate regarding this tool) and select your mark from the options that are
        shown. The result data that appears below includes your mark and the documentation associated with it that is
        stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also provide links to the Etherscan (an Ethereum blockchain “explorer” - like a search engine for a
        blockchain) record for each Ethereum Smart Contract associated with the data. It is in these contracts that your
        data is stored in “byte code.” Our tool is extracting the data and displaying it in a more user-friendly format
        for you. For design marks (those consisting of an image), we include the design hash along with the mark image.
        This hash is a SHA-256 hash representation of the image data (the EXACT IMAGE that was provided to Cognate at
        the time of your data submission, the image shown here in this tool IS THAT IMAGE -- another version of your
        design mark image will not work) and is what is stored on the Ethereum blockchain (the image is not). You can
        use this hash to prove the existence of your mark image at the point in time that the blockchain record exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        To generate a SHA-256 hash for your image or other file, you can use the SHA-256 Generator tool provided below.
        Just drag and drop a file into the box or use any SHA-256 tool
        <a href="https://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator" target="_blank">like this one</a>. The SHA-256 hash
        of your design image will match the hash that is stored on the blockchain. This is known as Proof of Existence.
        We have employed the same methodology for your Proof of Use documents, however for data protection reasons,
        those documents have been provided to you to keep hold of outside of this tool. It’s crucial that you use the
        exact image file for your Proof of Use document when generating the hash. Finally, here is a link to the
        <a href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access" target="_blank"
          >GitHub repository for this tool's source code</a
        >.
