  <h5>Ethereum</h5>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> is the backing blockchain network where Cognate
    chose to store trademark data. We developed a series of smart contracts that are published to Ethereum and were
    used in the creation and retrieve of trademark data. With the Ethereum address of your trademark can you can pull up
    the raw bytecode data that is stored within. Using our smart contract code it is possible to retrieve and view said
    data. This is what our tool does for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> is a blockchain explorer. It can be used to see
    transactions committed to Ethereum. This includes the trademark data that we stored within. Knowing your address you
    can view the raw bytecode in a web browser as well as see other related bits of information such as (but not
    including) any child transactions and documents or other unrelated transactions what utilized our smart contract
    code. You can even view statistics about ETH including how much we might have spent to store data there.
  </p>
  <h5>SHA-256 and Proof of Existence</h5>
  <p>
    Cognate never actually stored images on the blockchain. There are two driving factors behind this. First, storing
    images and other large documents in a public blockchain is just too expensive. Second, data that is put on the
    blockchain is there for the life of the blockchain (read forever). This would make it hard to allow a user to be
    forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
    What this means for a design mark or proof of use is that we took the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> hash of the file and stored that on the
    blockchain. This would be something like:
    <code>0xd0470b0caabac1bed10bf1f958d14117f8996a85d4caaa8c3fc363994180b414</code>. A SHA hash is not reversible so the
    data represented is blind. It will also always produce the same output for a given input. SHA-256 allows for 2^256
    different outcomes; thus the likelihood of a collision (meaning two different pieces of data produce the same hash)
    becomes statistically probable with half that number of keys. So it is impossible for someone to alter a design
    image or proof in a meaningful way and hope to be able to produce the same hash. This, too, is why it is is
    important to use the same, unaltered file or one would end up with a different hash entirely. Even a single pixel
    difference will produce an entirely different hash and void that file's ability to help prove claims.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of this plays into

      Proof of Existence
    </a>
    and its strength on a blockchain. A set of data is stored on a blockchain of which there is a hash and a timestamp.
    An individual has a file (image) which can be used to produce a hash. If the hash of the file and the hash in the
    blockchain are the same one can reason that the file existed at the timestamp in the blockchain. Thus proving that
    the file existed, in an unaltered form compared to now, at that time. Couple that with the fact that the blockchain
    is tamper-proof, this makes for infallible evidence that a trademark's design or proof of use existed and was in use
    at the time.

  <h5>This Codebase</h5>
  <p>
    If you are curious, this code is mostly just HTML and JavaScript. The project is hosted in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access/">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js">Web3</a> to connect to and pull information
      out of Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
      We use the <a target="_blank" href="https://infura.io/">Infura network</a> to access Ethereum without needing our
      own node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our smart contract code is available
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access/tree/master/src/contracts">here</a>. We have
      4 versions of the code as it evolved over the years we operated. There are trademarks on Ethereum in existence
      that use each version.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code that pulls the data from Ethereum is located
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access/blob/master/src/trademark.js">here</a>. It
      simply looks up an address and then resolves as much raw data as possible. This is what would be downloaded by a
      trademark lookup.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code that generates the SHA-256 for an image is located
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cognate/trademark-access/blob/master/src/util.js">here</a>. It simply
      takes the data (as a buffer) and returns the code.
    </li>
    <li>
      We utilize <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host our site. It offers an
      indefinite solution which will hopefully be available as long as the Ethereum network is.
